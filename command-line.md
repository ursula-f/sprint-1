1. What is the Command Line?
It's how people interacted with the computer before graphics interfaces were made. Instead of clicking on folders, you can type in a 'command' to get inside the folder instead. Anything you can do using your mouse, you can do by typing inside the command line. It's a good way to understand how the system files work and where everything is placed.

2. 10 Terminal Commands
mkdir - makes a folder
rmdir - deletes that folder
pwd - tells you where on the computer you are
ls - lists the contents of a folder
cd - allows you to move around the computer (navigate)
